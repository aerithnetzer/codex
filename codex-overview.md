How can the age of big data and supercomputing aid cultural and literary analysis? We investigate the challenges, setbacks, insights, techniques, and tools used to generate massive models on terabyte-scale text analysis of literature relating to the Anthropocene. Specifically, we will discuss the difficulty in relying on external data vendors, using the Quest supercomputing center, and problems of data management when attempting to compute on national lab-scale on the budget of a library.
